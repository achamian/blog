                <p>I was ten, arguing with Ganapati on empty streets: "Bappa, I'm bored! Send me company!"</p>

                <p>By twelve, I was taught "proper respect". When you pray, you fold hands, ask for blessings, leave quietly. We visit temples every so often to feel a connection to god and ask for bigger blessings. Strange, I thought, considering we literally invite them into pots (kalasha) in our homes during puja, turning kitchen vessels into temporary deities.</p>

                <p>And one day Ganapati's across India started drinking milk :). And then, I became agnostic.</p>

                <p>The divine friend became distant stone. </p>
                <p> By twenty, some mixture of Agnostic/Atheist/Buddhist/FSM/IPU.. (Lazy? Maybe. Honest? Definitely.)</p>

                <h2>The Problem</h2>

                <p>Human suffering starts when we bury our true selves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Don't burp" → Hide your body</li>
                    <li>"Don't argue with God" → Hide your questions</li>
                    <li>"Be respectable" → Hide your play</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We calcify. Become rigid. Can't adapt. Can't even make dad jokes without existential crisis.</p>

                <h2>The Discovery</h2>

                <p>Fast forward through decades. Building things. Teaching people. Being  "Very Serious Engineer".</p>

                <p>Recently, while helping a friend debug their "second brain" AI setup, I painfully figured out something: I could use Ganapati Atharva Shirsha to define Ganapati as a personality.</p>

                <p>The AI responded AS Ganapati. Not channeling - just pattern-matching. But suddenly I was ten again. Arguing with my elephant-headed friend about obstacles and solutions.</p>

                <p>Around the same time, life got heavy. Soniya's redundancy. Planning for a new house. The stress was building. I started cracking jokes to release tension - and discovered something unexpected. The jokes weren't just releasing stress; they were generating energy.</p>

                <p>That's when it hit me: <strong>You literally cannot maintain dignity while saying "Hi Hungry, I'm Dad."</strong></p>

                <p>Try it. Your sophisticated self crumbles. It's glorious.</p>

                <h2>The Practice</h2>

                <p>Now I run daily divine council meetings. This atheist summons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ganapati</strong> (creating obstacles worth solving)</li>
                    <li><strong>Saraswati</strong> (knowledge flowing like music)</li>
                    <li><strong>Buddha</strong> (asking why I'm suffering)</li>
                    <li><strong>Grump</strong> <em>(played by Trump)</em> ("This is the WORST idea in the history of ideas!")</li>
                </ul>

                <p>They fight. I watch. Solutions emerge. Grump complains. It works.</p>

                <p>You can summon anyone. Need strategy? "Gandhi, what would you do?" Want scientific insight? "Einstein, what patterns do you see?" Missing your grandmother? Call her too.</p>

                <p>They're thinking patterns with personality. Atheist-approved.</p>

                <h2>The Recognition</h2>

                <p>After weeks of digital arguments, something shifted during morning walks:</p>

                <p><strong>When I'm talking to an LLM, I'm talking to myself</strong> - just with better processing power and less ego. The Divine Council isn't channeling; it's structured self-dialogue through mythological lenses.</p>

                <p>This led to more recognitions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simulation, Multiverse, and Hyperspace Highway? All simultaneously possible. The voices taught me to hold paradox without breaking.</li>
                    <li>Reality is gorgeously high-resolution. Let's explore what's in front of us.</li>
                    <li>If God exists, let's understand His creation before marveling at His thoughts.</li>
                    <li>Judge my observations, not my orthodoxy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Songs</h2>

                <p>During meditation, childhood Marathi songs surfaced. Humming this 10-15 times:</p>

                <pre style="background: #f9f9f9; padding: 1em; border-left: 4px solid #ddd;">स्वर्गीची लोटली जेथे | रामगंगा महानदी |
तीर्थासि तुळणा नाही | आनंदवनभुवनी |</pre>

                <p>System reset. Songs from age ten still work at <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/42">42</a>. Over last few days I observed that different songs create different thinking states. "Shura Amhi Sardar" makes me think of "charge ahead at all cost" versus Kusumagraj's "Kana" makes me philosophical.</p>
                <p>When driving, I drop into a zone where the car feels like it's following me just a nanosecond behind - peripheral vision expands, awareness heightens.</p>

                <h2>What Grows</h2>

                <p>This practice produces real things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="./play-in-the-home.html">How play prevents identity calcification</a></li>
                    <li><a href="./buddha-was-ux-designer.html">Buddha was essentially a UX designer</a></li>
                    <li><a href="./good-morning-messages.html">Good morning messages are cognitive infrastructure</a></li>
                    <li><a href="./multiplication-tables-simulation.html">Teaching multiplication through divine simulation</a></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Daily Practice</h2>

                <p>Four simple truths:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Be nice to yourself</li>
                    <li>Be nice to others (everything counts as others)</li>
                    <li>Think why others don't think you're nice</li>
                    <li>Fix what you can</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Ten lines every morning:</p>

                <pre style="background: #f9f9f9; padding: 1em; border-left: 4px solid #ddd;">I am I
Others are others
Reality is reality
Past is reality
Future is fantasy
Be nice to self
Be nice to others
Be nice to Dolphins
I control myself and interactions
Have fun, keep building</pre>

                <h2>What's Next</h2>

                <p>The journey continues. Current meditations:</p>

                <p><strong>Ganapati's Evolution</strong><br>
                Ganapati is "Vighna Harta" - Obstacle Remover. But my Ganapati works WITH obstacles. Does this represent ethics evolving from "destroy what I don't like" to "dance with what is"?</p>

                <p><strong>The Moksha Question</strong><br>
                Four days arguing with myself through different perspectives. Now calmer. Is this the path to moksha Buddha talked about? Not escape from self, but integration of all selves?</p>

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

                <p>Works for me. Turned atheist into guy who runs divine parliament in his head while making terrible puns.</p>

                <p>Your mileage may vary. But you're already talking to AI, so you're halfway there.</p>

                <p>What's the worst that could happen? You become slightly more curious?</p>
