            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm a curious hacker who stumbled onto patterns I didn't expect. Through systematic experiments with LLM thinking tools, consistent phenomena emerged that challenge my assumptions about intelligence, consciousness, and collaboration.</p>
            
            <p>This isn't rigorous science - it's documented exploration. But the patterns are reproducible, the questions are profound, and the implications feel significant.</p>
