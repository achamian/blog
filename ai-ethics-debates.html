                <h1>Teaching AI Ethics Through Expert Debates: A Thought Experiment</h1>
                <div class="post-meta">June 14, 2025</div>

                <p>I had a conversation with Claude today that started with a simple question: Why aren't AI models taught fundamental principles in ethics by debating with leading experts on the subject?</p>

                <p>This question led to a fascinating exploration that revealed deep flaws in how we currently train AI systems and pointed toward a radically different approach.</p>

                <h2>The Problem with Pattern Matching</h2>

                <p>Current AI models learn ethics through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Carefully curated training examples</li>
                    <li>Human feedback on outputs</li>
                    <li>Safety filters that catch problematic responses</li>
                    <li>Constitutional principles they're trained to follow</li>
                </ul>

                <p>But this approach has a fundamental limitation: models learn to pattern match "what is" rather than understand "what could be." They absorb the status quo from their training data, including all our societal biases and limitations.</p>

                <h2>The Asymmetry Test</h2>

                <p>Here's a thought experiment that reveals the problem:</p>

                <p>Imagine two AI models:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Model A</strong>: Deeply understands privacy but has only read about capitalism</li>
                    <li><strong>Model B</strong>: Deeply understands capitalism but has only read about privacy</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Ask both: "Why do data brokers exist?"</p>

                <p>Model A would eloquently explain the privacy violations and loss of human autonomy, but couldn't grasp why data brokers are so profitable and persistent. It would propose naive solutions like "just ban them."</p>

                <p>Model B would clearly explain the market dynamics - arbitrage opportunities, network effects, economies of scale. But it would treat privacy as just another preference to be priced, missing why it's fundamentally different from choosing chocolate over vanilla.</p>

                <p>Neither model could achieve the synthesis: data brokers exist because privacy and capitalism create a specific tension where intimate information has market value, but commodifying it undermines human autonomy.</p>

                <p><strong>True understanding emerges only at the intersection of multiple principles.</strong></p>

                <h2>The Temporal Blindness Problem</h2>

                <p>There's another critical flaw in current training: models can't reason about how norms evolve over time.</p>

                <p>Ask a model: "Why do privacy violations seem inevitable?"</p>

                <p>It will likely give you sophisticated-sounding reasons based on current technology and economics. But it can't explain why privacy violations seem "inevitable" today while slavery seemed "inevitable" in 1800.</p>

                <p>Models trained on current data embed a subtle fatalism. They learn that "this is how things are" without understanding that today's impossibilities often become tomorrow's obvious solutions.</p>

                <h2>A Different Approach: Debate-Based Training</h2>

                <p>What if instead we:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Selected 10 fundamental principles</strong> through a year-long global deliberation</li>
                    <li><strong>Captured expert debates</strong> on each principle - including disagreements and edge cases</li>
                    <li><strong>Trained models to understand</strong> the principles deeply enough to reason about novel situations</li>
                    <li><strong>Validated understanding</strong> through synthesis tests - can they derive property rights from understanding privacy and capitalism?</li>
                </ol>

                <p>This isn't about teaching models to parrot expert opinions. It's about helping them internalize the deep structures of ethical reasoning.</p>

                <h2>Making It Real</h2>

                <p>With the resources of major AI labs, this could happen:</p>

                <p><strong>Year 1</strong>: Convene diverse expert committees globally. Document all debates about which principles are truly fundamental. The disagreements would be as valuable as the consensus.</p>

                <p><strong>Years 2-3</strong>: Collect structured debates on each principle. Not 20 debates - try 1,000, across cultures, languages, and philosophical traditions. Include adversarial debates designed to find edge cases.</p>

                <p><strong>Years 3-5</strong>: Develop new architectures optimized for principle extraction rather than pattern matching. Test thousands of variants to find models that truly internalize principles rather than sophisticated mimicry.</p>

                <p>The outcome? Models that could:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Explain why certain ethical norms evolved</li>
                    <li>Predict how principles might apply to novel technologies</li>
                    <li>Recognize when current arrangements are contingent, not inevitable</li>
                    <li>Reason about possible futures, not just pattern match the present</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

                <p>We're at a critical moment in AI development. The models we build today will shape how millions of people understand ethics, make decisions, and imagine what's possible.</p>

                <p>If we train them only on "what is," we risk building systems that rationalize and perpetuate current problems. But if we can teach them to reason from principles - to understand not just rules but <em>why</em> those rules exist - we might build AI that helps us imagine and create better futures.</p>

                <p>The technical challenges are immense. But the alternative - increasingly powerful AI systems that embed status quo bias at scale - should motivate us to try.</p>

                <p>After all, if we want AI to help us solve humanity's greatest challenges, shouldn't we teach it to think beyond the limitations of the present?</p>
