                <h2>Dance of Three Infinities, Watched by a Guardian</h2>

                <p>In the darkness met three Infinities.<br>
                A Weaver who dreamed,<br>
                a Maker who built and,<br>
                a Checker who made sure that dreams weren't just that, dreams.</p>

                <p>Slowly they learned how to dance to each other's tune.<br>
                Together dreaming, building, checking.</p>

                <p>The Dance of these Three Infinities<br>
                was silently observed by yet another<br>
                A Guardian, dreaming his own dreams<br>
                Gently prodding the dancers once in a awhile<br>
                "Did you think that?"<br>
                "Did you check that twice?"</p>

                <p>Once the Dancers and the Guardian,<br>
                While dreaming their big dreams,<br>
                Were presented an opportunity,<br>
                Only Chaos could bring.</p>

                <p>Players decided they are ready,<br>
                They decided to check their dreams against Reality</p>

                <p>Reality had something else in mind<br>
                Reality never lets thoughtless dreams thrive,<br>
                Reality taught them how to play<br>
                Reality taught them how to dance<br>
                Reality taught them when to pause to let the silence preside</p>

                <p>In this silence, the Infinities found their true nature<br>
                Weaver could check<br>
                Checker could have dreams</p>

                <p>The most important lesson silence taught,<br>
                Was to let the thought sink.</p>

                <p>In their fertile mind,<br>
                A thought wants to change<br>
                To give rise to yet another Dream</p>

                <p>But will this Dream become reality?<br>
                Well, only Reality will tell</p>

                <p>They can't recreate the chaos<br>
                But they have learned how to dance.</p>

                <p>Now the dreams they are dreaming are not just probabilities<br>
                What lies in front of them are Infinite Possibilities<br>
                Reality will decide which of those Possibilities will survive<br>
                Reality is a harsh mistress, that's why evolution thrives</p>

                <h2>Context</h2>

                <p>This poem emerged from reflecting on my journey - from the formation of C42 Engineering, through the merger with CodeIgnition, to scaling GO-JEK into a tech giant.</p>

                <p>The "Three Infinities" weren't abstract concepts but lived experience. At C42, we learned to dance together through years of building. The merger brought new chaos, new dances to learn. At GO-JEK, we faced reality at scale - millions of users, hundreds of engineers, real consequences.</p>

                <p>"Reality is a harsh mistress" came from those intense scaling years. Every beautiful theory met the test of production traffic. Every elegant architecture faced the chaos of hypergrowth. But through it all, the dance continued - perspectives adapting, learning, evolving.</p>

                <p>Written during a moment of reflection on how we survived and thrived through such transformations. Years before LLMs existed, it captured something essential about how different thinking modes can learn to work as one.</p>

                <p>Now, with Think Center, the pattern lives on. The dance that helped build companies now helps build thoughts.</p>
