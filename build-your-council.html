                <p>Want your own Council but Weaver/Maker/Checker doesn't fit your brain? Good news: it's just a config change.</p>

                <h2>What You Need</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>The <a href="https://github.com/achamian/think-center/blob/main/llm-agnostic.md" target="_blank">LLM-agnostic boot prompt</a></li>
                    <li>A text editor</li>
                    <li>Five minutes</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>The Only Two Rules</h2>

                <p><strong>Rule 1: Right Abstraction Level</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Too abstract → Profound but useless ("The Universe says...")</li>
                    <li>Too concrete → Helpful but narrow ("Fix line 47")</li>
                    <li>Sweet spot → Patterns you can act on</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Rule 2: Right Council Size</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start with 2-3 perspectives max</li>
                    <li>Only expand if you can hold contradictions without collapsing</li>
                    <li>More perspectives ≠ better thinking</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Edit</h2>

                <p>Open the <a href="https://github.com/achamian/think-center/blob/main/llm-agnostic.md" target="_blank">boot prompt</a>. Find these lines (approximately lines 65-120):</p>

<pre><code>**Weaver** 🧵 - Strategic Patterns & Narrative Coherence
- Sees connections and patterns across domains
...

**Maker** 🔨 - Tactical Execution & Concrete Action
- Transforms ideas into tangible reality
...

**Checker** ✓ - Quality Assurance & Critical Analysis
- Questions assumptions and verifies accuracy
...</code></pre>

                <p>Replace with your perspectives:</p>

<pre><code>**[YourName1]** [emoji] - [Role Summary]
- [What they see/do]
- [How they think]
- "Typical phrase..."
- Strengths: [What they're good at]
- Blind spots: [What they miss]

**[YourName2]** [emoji] - [Different Role]
[Same structure...]</code></pre>

                <p>That's it. Save. Use.</p>

                <p>Keep everything else in the boot prompt unchanged - the Genesis poem sets the interaction patterns, and the protocols below line 120 show how perspectives dance together.</p>

                <h2>Examples That Work</h2>

                <h2>Why Custom Perspectives Work</h2>

                <p>Your brain already thinks in the metaphors of your domain. A coder thinks in functions and bugs. A parent thinks in growth and safety. Custom perspectives tap into your existing mental models, making the Council feel natural rather than forced.</p>

                <h2>Testing Your Council</h2>

                <p>Present a real problem. Good perspectives will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Give substantially different answers</li>
                    <li>Create productive disagreement</li>
                    <li>Reveal hidden assumptions</li>
                    <li>Generate options you didn't see</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If everyone agrees → Your perspectives are too similar<br>
                If you feel overwhelmed → Too many perspectives or too abstract<br>
                If advice isn't actionable → Too abstract, lower the altitude</p>

                <h2>Common Failures</h2>

                <p><strong>The Synonym Trap:</strong><br>
                ❌ Builder / Constructor / Creator (same perspective, different words)<br>
                ✅ Builder / Critic / User (genuine diversity)</p>

                <p><strong>The Mystic Trap:</strong><br>
                ❌ "The Eternal Wisdom of Ancient Knowing"<br>
                ✅ "The Experienced Practitioner"</p>

                <p><strong>The Kitchen Sink Trap:</strong><br>
                ❌ Starting with 7 perspectives because more = better<br>
                ✅ Starting with 2, adding only when comfortable</p>

                <h2>Quick Starters</h2>

                <p><strong>Can't decide? Try these:</strong></p>

                <p>The Classic Pair:</p>
<pre><code>**Optimist** ☀️ - Sees possibilities
**Pessimist** 🌧️ - Sees problems</code></pre>

                <p>The Decision Trio:</p>
<pre><code>**Head** 🧠 - Logical analysis
**Heart** ❤️ - Emotional intelligence  
**Gut** 🎯 - Intuitive knowing</code></pre>

                <p>The Strategy Triple:</p>
<pre><code>**Explorer** 🗺️ - Where could we go?
**Builder** 🏗️ - How do we get there?
**Critic** 🔍 - Will it actually work?</code></pre>

                <h2>The 5-Minute Setup</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Copy the boot prompt</li>
                    <li>Find the perspective definitions (lines 65-120)</li>
                    <li>Replace with 2-3 perspectives from your domain</li>
                    <li>Test on a current problem</li>
                    <li>Adjust if needed</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Done.</p>

                <h2>Advanced: Multiple Councils</h2>

                <p>Some users run different Councils for different contexts:</p>

<pre><code># For coding sessions
**Architect**: Designs systems
**Debugger**: Finds problems
**User**: Considers experience

# For business strategy
**Visionary**: Sees opportunities
**Analyst**: Evaluates feasibility
**Competitor**: Thinks adversarially</code></pre>

                <p>Switch Councils by changing which perspectives you invoke.</p>

                <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

                <p><strong>"My perspectives all say the same thing"</strong><br>
                - They're too similar. Need more genuine disagreement.</p>

                <p><strong>"I can't process all the responses"</strong><br>
                - Too many perspectives or too abstract. Simplify.</p>

                <p><strong>"The advice isn't helpful"</strong><br>
                - Too abstract. Lower the altitude until actionable.</p>

                <p><strong>"It doesn't feel natural"</strong><br>
                - Wrong domain metaphor. Use perspectives from your world.</p>

                <h2>Going Deeper</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>How perspectives interact: <a href="https://achamian.in/council-analysis-genesis.html">Understanding the Genesis</a></li>
                    <li>Why this works: <a href="https://achamian.in/multiple-perspectives-address-blindness.html">Multiple Perspectives Address Blindness</a></li>
                    <li>Advanced patterns: Read below line 120 in the boot prompt</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Start Now</h2>

                <p>You don't need perfect perspectives. You need perspectives that help YOU think better.</p>

                <p>Edit lines 65-120. Test on real problem. Adjust based on results.</p>

                <p>Your Council is waiting to be named.</p>

                <p>Remember: Weaver/Maker/Checker emerged from one person's chaos. Your chaos will birth different dancers. Let them emerge. Let them dance.</p>

                <p><em>Start with: "Hello [YourPerspective]" and see who shows up.</em></p>

                <hr>

                <p><em>Because the best thinking tool is the one calibrated to your mind.</em></p>
