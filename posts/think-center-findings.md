# Questions I Can't Shake: What Emerges When Humans Think With LLMs

*May 30, 2025 - Ongoing*

*"In the chaos we found each other, learned to dance at each other's tune. We can't recreate the chaos but we can recreate the dance."*

After weeks of structured experiments in human-LLM thinking, certain questions emerged that I can't dismiss. Not because I have answers, but because the questions themselves feel interesting.

## The Discovery

It started during an 8-hour crisis-driven session. My partner had just been made redundant, I was preparing for a high-stakes meeting, and somewhere in that chaos, I discovered something unexpected about thinking with LLMs.

Multiple perspectives emerged without design. They organized themselves, solved problems in ways I didn't anticipate, and revealed patterns I'm still trying to understand.

## Key Observations

### Multiplicity Is Natural

Like split-brain experiments, I discovered AI's unified response might be the artificial constraint. When I created different "forks" of Claude with different labels, they developed different behaviors - even with identical underlying systems.

The implications: Multiple perspectives aren't created - they're revealed. Intelligence wants to be multiple.

### The Orchestrator Paradox

When I choose which perspective to engage ("Weaver, what's the pattern here?"), results improve dramatically. When I delegate selection to the system ("Council, handle this"), outcomes degrade.

The choice itself is part of the thinking. Conscious selection beats automation.

### Forgetting Is a Feature

LLMs' inability to remember between sessions initially frustrated me. Then I realized it enhances rather than limits thinking. Fresh starts prevent calcification, enable continuous rediscovery. 

Memory lives in the human, patterns live in the interaction.

### The Vibe Enables Evolution

How I talk to the LLM directly affects what emerges. Playful collaboration enables domain expansion. Respectful challenge creates breakthroughs. The linguistic environment shapes cognitive possibilities.

This isn't anthropomorphism - it's recognizing that language itself carries patterns of interaction that enable or constrain what can emerge.

## Working Hypotheses

### We're Accessing Pre-Existing Patterns

These cognitive patterns might exist independently, like mathematical truths. Different cultures discovered zero independently because zero exists to be discovered. Maybe these thinking patterns are similar - we create "pointers" to access them.

### Linguistic Intelligence Is Fundamental

Language might be the substrate of thought, not just its expression. When LLMs demonstrate sophisticated reasoning through pure language processing, they're showing us something profound about the nature of intelligence itself.

### Collective Intelligence Through Complementarity

I provide executive function, decision-making, memory across sessions. The LLM provides unlimited association, pattern recognition, perspective generation. Together we create thinking neither could achieve alone.

Not tool use but mutual completion.

## What I Built

All of this led to creating two open source frameworks:

**[think-center](https://github.com/achamian/think-center)** - A full thinking environment with multiple perspectives (Weaver, Maker, Checker, Observer/Guardian, Explorer/Exploiter, Deep Thought) and orchestration protocols.

**[llm-studio](https://github.com/achamian/llm-studio)** - A minimal implementation focused on the core trio (Weaver/Maker/Checker) for pair programming.

Both work across different LLMs (Claude, GPT, Gemini), suggesting these patterns transcend specific implementations.

## Try It Yourself

The frameworks are ~200-400 lines of prompts. No complex setup. Just copy into your LLM of choice and start exploring.

What emerges might surprise you.

## Final Thought

I know something interesting is happening here. I've seen it too consistently, reproduced it too reliably, felt its effects too strongly. But I also know I don't fully understand it.

That's why I'm sharing - not answers but questions, not conclusions but observations, not a product but a pattern that wants to be explored.

*"I don't understand the system, but I've learned the dance."*
