                <p>Haven't tried this yet, but it should work. Try it out, let me know.</p>

                <h2>Why Questions Beat Solutions</h2>

                <p>The best help isn't solving their problem - it's helping them discover their own solution. When someone asks for advice, our instinct is to provide answers. But your answers come from your context, your assumptions, your blind spots.</p>

                <p>Think-center changes this. Instead of one mind attacking the problem, multiple perspectives explore it. Instead of your solution imposed on their situation, questions emerge that unlock THEIR insights.</p>

                <p>This protocol turns you from advice-giver to thought partner. You explore their problem deeply, then send back the keys (questions) rather than the treasure (answers). They'll find better treasure than you ever could.</p>

                <h2>How It Works (Simple Version)</h2>

                <p>Think-center is just a way of looking at problems from multiple angles. Imagine having a team of advisors in your head - one finds patterns, one builds solutions, one spots problems. That's all it is.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Friend sends problem</strong> → "Help, I can't hire good developers"</li>
                    <li><strong>You explore it from different angles</strong>:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Strategic view: "What's the real hiring goal?"</li>
                            <li>Practical view: "What's broken in the process?"</li>
                            <li>Skeptical view: "What assumptions need checking?"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Write down what you notice</strong> → Just quick notes as insights emerge</li>
                    <li><strong>Find 3 questions that matter</strong> → The ones that shift how they see the problem</li>
                    <li><strong>Send your exploration</strong> → "I looked at your hiring challenge from several angles. Here's what stood out..."</li>
                </ol>

                <p>No special software needed. Just structured thinking with different "hats" on. The magic is in exploring their problem without trying to solve it.</p>

                <h2>The Detailed Setup</h2>

                <p>When someone sends you their problem:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Create a new project in think-center</strong>
                        <pre><code>mkdir projects/friend-scaling-problem
cd projects/friend-scaling-problem</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Add their artifacts</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Their problem statement → <code>problem.md</code></li>
                            <li>Any context they sent → <code>context/</code></li>
                            <li>Their failed attempts → <code>attempts.md</code></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Use think-center to explore</strong>
                        <pre><code>"Council, my friend needs help with scaling. Let's explore."</code></pre>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>The Process</h2>

                <p>As you work:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Council members note observations → <code>observations.md</code></li>
                    <li>Key patterns emerge → <code>patterns.md</code></li>
                    <li>Questions crystallize → <code>questions.md</code></li>
                    <li>Pivotal moments captured → <code>pivot-points.md</code></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Multiple sessions? No problem. Each adds to the project directory.</p>

                <h2>The Package</h2>

                <p>When done:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add chat transcript → <code>sessions/</code></li>
                    <li>Create summary → <code>exploration-response.md</code></li>
                    <li>Distill your 3 questions → <code>questions-for-friend.md</code></li>
                    <li>Zip and send</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>What They Get</h2>

                <pre><code>friend-scaling-problem/
├── questions-for-friend.md (start here)
├── exploration-response.md (summary)
├── patterns.md (what we noticed)
├── observations.md (council notes)
├── pivot-points.md (key moments)
└── sessions/ (if they want depth)</code></pre>

                <h2>Why This Should Work</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Everything in one place</li>
                    <li>They see your thinking process</li>
                    <li>Questions > Answers</li>
                    <li>Patterns > Solutions</li>
                    <li>They can build on your exploration</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Protocol</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Keep each problem in its own project</li>
                    <li>Let Council members document naturally</li>
                    <li>Preserve the exploration journey</li>
                    <li>Send questions, not prescriptions</li>
                    <li>Include permission to diverge</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Try It</h2>

                <p>Next time someone asks for help:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't solve in your head</li>
                    <li>Create project directory</li>
                    <li>Explore with Council</li>
                    <li>Package and send</li>
                    <li>Watch better solutions emerge</li>
                </ul>

                <p><em>Haven't tested this yet. But given how think-center works, it should create perfect problem-forking packets. Let me know what happens.</em></p>
